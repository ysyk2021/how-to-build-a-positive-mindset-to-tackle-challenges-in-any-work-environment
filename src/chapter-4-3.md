Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment, without judgment or distraction. It involves focusing one's attention on the present rather than worrying about past experiences or future events.

In the workplace, mindfulness can be promoted through various techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga. Mindfulness training sessions can also be conducted for employees to help them develop this skill.

Incorporating Daily Practices
